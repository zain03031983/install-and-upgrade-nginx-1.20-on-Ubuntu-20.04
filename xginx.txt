Install Howto
If you want to install version 1.20.2 specifically, you will need to add the official nginx repository to your Sources list.

Here is how you do it:

Open Terminal (or connect via SSH)

Ensure you have all of the prerequisites installed:

sudo apt install curl gnupg2 ca-certificates lsb-release ubuntu-keyring
Import the nginx signing key for apt:

curl https://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key | gpg --dearmor \
     | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null

Create a sources .list file for apt:

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg] \
     http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` nginx" \
     | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list
Pin the repository to ensure the nginx packages are installed instead of the Ubuntu-provided packages:

echo -e "Package: *\nPin: origin nginx.org\nPin: release o=nginx\nPin-Priority: 900\n" \
     | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/99-nginx
Update apt:

sudo apt update
Install nginx:

sudo apt install nginx
thankyoyu!
